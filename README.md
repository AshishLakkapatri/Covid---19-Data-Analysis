- COVID-19 Dataset from John Hopkins University
- World Happiness Report Dataset

## Data Preparation:

- Imported COVID-19 data using pandas.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleansing.
- Aggregated data by countries.
- Visualized cumulative confirmed cases.

## Spread Measurement and Analysis:

- Analyzed daily changes.
- Calculated maximum infection rates.
- Applied analysis to various countries.

## Integration and Comprehensive Analysis:

- Integrated World Happiness Report data.
- Merged datasets for a holistic view.
- Explored correlations through a correlation matrix.

## Visualization of Insights:

- Discovered positive correlations between infection rates and life factors.
- Plotted GDP per capita against the maximum infection rate.
- Applied regression line for enhanced visualization.

## Conclusion:

Analysis suggests a heightened COVID-19 susceptibility in more developed countries.
